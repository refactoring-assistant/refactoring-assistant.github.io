# Duplicate Code

## Description (What)

Code that is duplicated in a class. Duplicated code may be harder to find if for example two methods do the exact same thing but have different names.

## How to Locate It (Where)

Modern IDEs usually do a good job of finding duplicate code if configured correctly.
Otherwise simply look for code snippets in your class that look eerily similar

## How it Manifests (Why)

Two different developers might make two different functions that perform the same task unknowingly. This can also be caused by copy-pasting code snippets.

## How to Fix It (Possible Treatments)

In Example 1, two methods perform identical functions but have different names in which case `Extract Method` is used to combine both the functions into a single function.

There are multiple possible situations in which duplicate code might arise, like when two subclasses have duplicate methods or if duplicate code is found in two different classes.

In Example 2, `Extract Method` is used, meaning that we could extract the reusable logics and make it a private method. This treatment is mainly used for some similar logic appearing

in the codebase for multiple times.

Other treatments are also possible based on the specific scenario, they can be found [here](https://refactoring.guru/smells/duplicate-code#:~:text=Treatment)

## Examples

### Example 1

#### Before:

Functions Add() and Sum() are functionally identical.

```
Observed Code Smells:
- Duplicate Code (lines 10-12, 26-29 )
```

#### After:

Applied `Extract Method` as itâ€™s a duplication in the same class.

```
Refactoring Applied:
- Duplicate Code
    - Extract Method (Sum)
```

```
Observed Code Smells After Refactoring:
- None
```

### Example 2

#### Before:

Usually, the duplicated part can be extracted as a method.

It may be just the code are produced by 2 different developers and someone has to refactor

to get rid of the duplication.

```
Observed Code Smells:
- Duplicated Code (lines 26-28, lines 41-43)
```

#### After:

Identify the duplicated code and extract them as a private helper method.

```
Refactoring Applied:
- Duplicated Code:
    - Extract method (lines 42-49)
```

```
Observed Code Smells After Refactoring:
- None
```
