				<main><h1>Duplicate Code</h1>
<h2>Description (What)</h2>
<p>Code that is duplicated in a class. Duplicated code may be harder to find if for example two methods do the exact same thing but have different names.</p>
<h2>How to Locate It (Where)</h2>
<p>Modern IDEs usually do a good job of finding duplicate code if configured correctly.
Otherwise simply look for code snippets in your class that look eerily similar</p>
<h2>How it Manifests (Why)</h2>
<p>Two different developers might make two different functions that perform the same task unknowingly. This can also be caused by copy-pasting code snippets.</p>
<h2>How to Fix It (Possible Treatments)</h2>
<p>In Example 1, two methods perform identical functions but have different names in which case <code>Extract Method</code> is used to combine both the functions into a single function.</p>
<p>There are mutliple possible situations in which duplicate code might arise, like when two subclasses have duplicate methods or if duplicate code is found in two different classes.</p>
<p>Other treatments are also possible based on the specific scenario, they can be found <a href="https://refactoring.guru/smells/duplicate-code#:~:text=Treatment">here</a></p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<h3>Example 1</h3>
<h4>Problem DUPCBE1.java</h4>
<p>Functions Add() and Sum() are functionally identical.</p>
<pre><code>Observed Code Smells:
- Duplicate Code (lines 10-12, 26-29 )
</code></pre>
<h4>Solution DUPCGE1.java</h4>
<p>Applied <code>Extract Method</code> as itâ€™s a duplication in the same class.</p>
<pre><code>Refactoring Applied:
- Duplicate Code
    - Extract Method (Sum)
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Observed Code Smells After Refactoring:
- None
</code></pre>
