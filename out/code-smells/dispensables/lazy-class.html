				<main><h1>Lazy Class</h1>
<h2>Description (What)</h2>
<p>A lazy class is a class that doesn't do much or doesn't contribute enough to warrant your attention.</p>
<h2>How to Locate It (Where)</h2>
<p>Find classes that appear small, have limited interaction with the rest of the program and don't contribute to the overall program.</p>
<h2>How It Manifests (Why)</h2>
<p>Classes that were originally designed to support some future work or have reduced in size by a lot after refactoring.</p>
<h2>How to Fix It (Possible Treatments)</h2>
<p>In Example 1, <code>Collapse Hierarchy</code> is used to remove the Lazy Class. <code>Collapse Hierarchy</code> works by removing a superclass that is not doing much more than simply than existing for the sake of hierarchy in the case of Lazy Class.</p>
<p>Other treatments are also possible based on the specific scenario, they can be found <a href="https://refactoring.guru/smells/lazy-class#:~:text=Treatment">here</a></p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<h3>Example 1</h3>
<h4>Problem LZCBE1.java</h4>
<p>Cheetah was added considering that it might have unique functionality in the future.</p>
<pre><code>Observed Code Smells:
- Lazy Class (lines 29-33)
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h4>Solution LZCGE1.java</h4>
<p>Applied <code>Collapse Hierarchy</code> to remove the class given that it is the same as the super class <code>Cat</code></p>
<pre><code>Refactoring Applied:
- Lazy Class
    - Collapse Hierarchy (Cheetah)
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Observed Code Smells After Refactoring:
- None
</code></pre>
<h2>When to Ignore</h2>
<p>In cases where classes are created in specific cases to project future work or extensions</p>
