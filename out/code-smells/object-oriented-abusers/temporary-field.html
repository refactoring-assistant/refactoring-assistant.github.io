				<main><h1>Temporary Field</h1>
<h2>Description (What)</h2>
<p>A field in a class that is given its value and then subsequently used by particular methods and are undefined in the rest of the cases.</p>
<h2>How to Locate It (Where)</h2>
<p>Look for fields that aren't explicity assigned a value in the constructor or are assigned default or garbage values in the constructor and fields that are used only in one method in the class and are assigned their proper values in that method.</p>
<p>Also look for fields that get their value based on type code/if-else/switch statements where they get their value based on satisfying a condition but remain unassigned in other conditions.</p>
<h2>How it Manifests (Why)</h2>
<p>Temporary fields might arise from the need of variables for complex algorithms or functions in a class that need them and are required to be defined in the fields of the class.</p>
<h2>How to Fix It (Possible Treatments)</h2>
<p>In Example 1, we use <code>Extract Class</code>. This treatment moves the fields and the methods that require them into their own class such that in the new class, the field is always assigned a proper value. This way the field is always populated with a correct value on object instantation.</p>
<p>Other treatments are also possible based on the specific scenario, they can be found <a href="https://refactoring.guru/smells/temporary-field#:~:text=Treatment">here</a></p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<h3>Example 1</h3>
<h4>Problem TFBE1.java</h4>
<p>Variables a and b are always used but c is used only when Quadratic/Cubic equations need to be solved and d only when Cubic equations need to be solved.</p>
<pre><code>Observed Code Smells:
- Temporary Field (lines 4-5)
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h4>Solution TFGE1.java</h4>
<p>Applied <code>Extract Class</code> to extract all the methods into their own Classes 'LinearSolver', 'QuadraticSolver' and 'CubicSolver' and deleted the original 'PolynomialSolver' class</p>
<pre><code>Refactoring Applied:
- Temporary Field
    - Extract Class (LinearSolver, QuadraticSolver, CubicSolver)
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Observed Code Smells After Refactoring:
- None
</code></pre>
