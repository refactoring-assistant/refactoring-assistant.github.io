				<main><h1>Switch Statements</h1>
<h2>Description (What)</h2>
<p>A complex switch statement of a long sequence of if-else-if statements. Having these causes code to become difficult to maintain in the long run as new conditions are added or new requirements are added, existing code is required to be changed.</p>
<h2>How to Locate It (Where)</h2>
<p>Look for long switch statements and long sequences of if-else-if statements based on type code.</p>
<h2>How It Manifests (Why)</h2>
<p>When a program starts out small, switch statements and if-else-if statements are easier to write based on type code but as the code base increases it becomes difficult to maintain these control flows as they may spread throughout the program and require changes in each place with the introduction of more types or conditions.</p>
<h2>How to Fix It (Possible Treatments)</h2>
<p>In Example 1, we use the <code>Replace Type Code With Strategy</code> treatment. Strategy pattern allows for better extendability through the use of maps of keys and values where the correct method is called based on the type keys.</p>
<p>Other treatments are also possible based on the specific scenario, they can be found <a href="https://refactoring.guru/smells/switch-statements#:~:text=Treatment">here</a></p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<h3>Example 1</h3>
<h4>Problem SWSBE1.java</h4>
<p>In CommandParser there is a big switch case that calls methods based on the command given to it.</p>
<pre><code>Observed Code Smells:
- Switch Statements (lines 33-53)
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h4>Solution SWSGE1.java</h4>
<p>Applied Replace Type Code With Strategy to create a new class that encapsulates each possible command which can provide the command name and execute the action of the command.</p>
<pre><code>Refactoring Applied:
- Switch Statements
    - Replace Type Code With Strategy (Action, AttackAction, ...)
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Observed Code Smells After Refactoring:
- None
</code></pre>
<h2>When to Ignore</h2>
<p>In cases where the switch statement of if-else-if statement is used for simple actions</p>
<p>In cases where the switch statement is required by the Factory Design Pattern</p>
