<h2>Description (What)</h2>
<p>Shotgun Surgery is when making a small change to one class leads you to make many small changes to other classes.</p>
<h2>How to Locate It (Where)</h2>
<p>Look for an extreme split up of responsibility: One responsbility that has been split up among many files.</p>
<h2>How It Manifests(Why)</h2>
<p>This code smell can occur because of overuse of treating <code>Divergent Change</code> code smell</p>
<p>In an attempt to follow Single Responsbility principle, you might be tempted to create a class for every small responsbility. In reality this may seem normal, but you have to add a logical minimum limit for defining a single responsibility. Creating many small classes that might together define a single responsbility can lead to having to make changes to many classes when trying to make a change to one class (one part of the larger responsbility).</p>
<h2>How to Fix It (Possible Treatments)</h2>
<p>In Example 1, <code>Move Method</code> is used to move methods back to a larger responsbility class. You should move methods that belong together in the larger logical grouping to one class.</p>
<p>Other treatments are also possible based on the specific scenario, they can be found <a href="https://refactoring.guru/smells/shotgun-surgery#:~:text=Treatment">here</a></p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<h3>Example 1</h3>
<h4>Problem SSBE1.java</h4>
<p>Both <code>CheckProcessor</code> class and <code>DirectDepositProcessor</code> classes print information about the <code>BankAccount</code> class. If there is any change in the way print is to be handled or another field is added to <code>BankAccount</code> class, change will need to be made to the other two classes as well.</p>
<pre><code>Observed Code Smells:
- Shotgun Surgery (lines 59,94-95)
- Feature Envy (lines 59, 94-95)
</code></pre>
<h4>Solution SSGE1.java</h4>
<p>Applied <code>Move Method</code> to move the printing logic to <code>BankAccount</code> class itself which also removes <code>Feature Envy</code> and now any change made to printing logic or any new fields that need to be printed (ex: balance) can be made in one class.</p>
<pre><code>Refactoring Applied:
- Shotgun Surgery
    - Move Method (printAccountDetails)
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Observed Code Smells After Refactoring:
- None
</code></pre>
<h2>When to Ignore</h2>
<p>None</p>
