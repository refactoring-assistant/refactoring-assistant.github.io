				<main><h1>Divergent Change</h1>
<h2>Description (What)</h2>
<p>Divergent Change is when you want to make changes to a field or a class as whole and end up having to also make changes to methods unrelated to that change in the class.</p>
<h2>How to Locate It (Where)</h2>
<p>Look for strong coupling between fields and methods. In general all fields that are being used in methods must be specific to that method.</p>
<h2>How It Manifests (Why)</h2>
<p>Divergent Change can occur due to a poor program structure. Especially when a class is not modular enough or contains strong coupling with fields.</p>
<h2>How to Fix It (Possible Treatments)</h2>
<p>In Example 1, <code>Extract Class</code> is used. <code>Extract Class</code> in this case is used because of strong coupling in the expectation of the structure of a field (validation), which causes changes when adding a new type of protocol in methods unrelated to that change.</p>
<p>Other treatments are also possible based on the specific scenario, they can be found <a href="https://refactoring.guru/smells/divergent-change#:~:text=Treatment">here</a></p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<h3>Example 1</h3>
<h4>Problem DVCHBE1.java</h4>
<p>If we were to add a new type of connection, we would have to make changes to both the unrelated methods getDomain() and checkValidUrl()</p>
<pre><code>Observed Code Smells:
- Divergent Change (lines 9-18, 20-27)
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h4>Solution DVCHGE1.java</h4>
<p>Applied <code>Extract Class</code> to split the behavior into two classes. Both classes have the same behavior so, created interface Connector for inheritance</p>
<pre><code>Refactoring Applied:
- Divergent Change
    - Extract Class (HTTPConnector, FTPConnector)
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Observed Code Smells After Refactoring:
- None
</code></pre>
<h2>When to Ignore</h2>
<p>None</p>
