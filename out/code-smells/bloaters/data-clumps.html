				<main><h1>Data Clumps</h1>
<h2>Description (What)</h2>
<p>An identical group of variables show up repeatedly.</p>
<p>These could be variables for connecting to a database, a client or repeatedly being passed across methods</p>
<h2>How to Locate It (Where)</h2>
<p>Look for repeated sets of variables in method arguments</p>
<h2>How It Manifests (Why)</h2>
<p>It's often easier to keep sending the list of variables to different functions.</p>
<p>It could also be due to 'copypasta programming'.</p>
<h2>How to Fix It (Possible Treatments)</h2>
<p>In Example 1, <code>Extract Class</code> is used to create a new class for the data clumps and the new class is passed in method arguments instead of the variables separately.</p>
<p>We want to be able to reduce the amount of parameters we pass to methods and also by passing an object of a class created for parameters, we make it easier to change anything about the parameters themselves in a single place instead of in all methods that take those parameters.</p>
<p>Other treatments are also possible based on the specific scenario, they can be found <a href="https://refactoring.guru/smells/data-clumps#:~:text=Treatment">here</a></p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<h3>Example 1</h3>
<h4>Before: DataClumpsSmelly.java</h4>
<p>The connection variables for the MongoDB connection are an identical group of variables that need to be grouped together.</p>
<pre><code>Observed Code Smells:
- Data Clumps (lines 2-5) 
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h4>After: DataClumpsRefactored.java</h4>
<p>Applied <code>Extract Class</code> on the variables to create their own class to be passed to the actual connecting class</p>
<pre><code>Refactoring Applied:
- Data Clumps
    - Extract Class (MongoDbConnectionVariables)
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Observed Code Smells After Refactoring:
- None
</code></pre>

<h3>Example 2</h3>
<h4>Before: DataClumpsSmelly.java</h4>
<hr>
<h4>After: DataClumpsRefactored.java</h4>
<h2>When to Ignore</h2>
<p>In cases where passing an object in method parameters might create an undesirable dependency between two classes</p>
