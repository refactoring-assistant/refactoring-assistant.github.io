				<main><h1>Large Class</h1>
<h2>Description (What)</h2>
<p>A class is violating the Single Responsibility principle and has grown to a large size. Ifa class contains too many lines of code, methods, fields and feel bloated, they can be considered a large class.</p>
<h2>How to Locate It (Where)</h2>
<p>Look for classes which have methods and fields relating to two or more different responsibilities</p>
<h2>How It Manifests (Why)</h2>
<p>If a programmer keeps adding functionality without making a new class because they feel that the new functionality doesn't warrant an entirely new class or if a programmer doesn't realize the scope of a class and adds too many functions and/or fields</p>
<h2>How to Fix It (Possible Treatments)</h2>
<p>In Example 1, we identify the parts (fields and methods) of the class that we can move out to a new class and then apply <code>Extract Class</code> in which we create a new class that is better suited to hosting the extra functionality of our current class</p>
<p>Other treatments are also possible based on the specific scenario, they can be found <a href="https://refactoring.guru/smells/large-class#:~:text=Treatment">here</a></p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<h3>Example 1</h3>
<h4>Before: LargeClassSmelly.java</h4>
<p>Calculator class has grown in size and is now handling too much functionality to be maintainable.</p>
<pre><code>Observed Code Smells:
- Large Class (line 1-35)
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h4>After: LargeClassRefactored.java</h4>
<p>Applied Extract Class to spin off some methods into their own class TrigonometricCalculator to reduce the size and responsibility of the Calculator class</p>
<pre><code>Refactoring Applied:
- Large Class
    - Extract Class (Calculator)
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Observed Code Smells After Refactoring:
- None
</code></pre>
