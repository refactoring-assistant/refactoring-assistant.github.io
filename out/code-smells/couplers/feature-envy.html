<h2>Description (What)</h2>
<p>When one method accesses the fields or methods of another object more than it does itself</p>
<h2>How to Locate It (Where)</h2>
<p>Look for methods where an object's fields or methods (objects either from the class' fields or passed through parameters) are used more than it's own classes fields or methods.</p>
<h2>How It Manifests (Why)</h2>
<p>It might be easier to use another object's fields or methods directly in the method of an object.</p>
<h2>How to Fix It (Possible Treatments)</h2>
<p>In Example 1, <code>Move Method</code> treatment is used. This treatment is applied when a method that is being called a lot by another class' method is actually better suited to that class itself. Doing this reduces the number of calls to another object and keeps changes easier and restricted to a single class.</p>
<p>Other treatments are also possible based on the specific scenario, they can be found <a href="https://refactoring.guru/smells/feature-envy#:~:text=Treatment">here</a></p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<h3>Example 1</h3>
<h4>Problem FEBE1.java</h4>
<p>The data of <code>Record</code> class, specifically genre, name and duration is accessed far more by the class <code>RecordPlayer</code> than <code>RecordPlayer</code> is accessing its own data</p>
<pre><code>Observed Code Smells:
- Feature Envy (lines 57-61, 63-66)
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h4>Solution FEGE1.java</h4>
<p>Used <code>Move Method</code> to move getFormattedDuration() and getCurrentRecordDetails() to the <code>Record</code> class as it is better suited.</p>
<pre><code>Refactoring Applied:
- Feature Envy
    - Move Method (getFormattedDuration, getCurrentRecordDetails)
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Observed Code Smells After Refactoring:
- None
</code></pre>
<h2>When to Ignore</h2>
<p>In cases where there is use of the Strategy Pattern or Visitor Pattern. Also in cases of Data Access Objects</p>
