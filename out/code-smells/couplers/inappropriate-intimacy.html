				<main><h1>Inappropriate Intimacy</h1>
<h2>Description (What)</h2>
<p>A class uses the interal fields and methods of an object directly</p>
<h2>How to Locate It (Where)</h2>
<p>Look for public fields being access by other classes. Classes should know as little about each other as possible.</p>
<h2>How It Manifests (Why)</h2>
<p>Can occur due to fields being public and being accessed by other classes because it is easier to do instead of creating a getter/setter method.</p>
<h2>How to Fix It (Possible Treatments)</h2>
<p>In Example 1, <code>Hide Delegate</code> is used. This treatment requires you to create getter and setter methods for the field that needs to be accessed to allow for an "official" relationship as compared to dirt mutating. If a public method is also being accessed along with the fields it is better to first <code>Extract Class</code> and create a new class and then move the fields and methods to that new class and use it from there.</p>
<p>Other treatments are also possible based on the specific scenario, they can be found <a href="https://refactoring.guru/smells/inappropriate-intimacy#:~:text=Treatment">here</a></p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<h3>Example 1</h3>
<h4>Problem IIBE1.java</h4>
<p><code>Library</code> class uses the internal fields of <code>Book</code> class as they are marked as public.</p>
<pre><code>Observed Code Smells:
- Inappropriate Intimacy (lines 38, 43, 44)
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h4>Solution IIGE1.java</h4>
<p>Applied <code>Hide Delegate</code> to make field private and create a getter for the field instead to make the relation "official" instead of directly mutating the field. This is step 2 of the Extract Class and Hide Delegate treatment but since only a field is being accessed, the <code>Extract Class</code> part seems unecessary and making the field private from public seems to be enough.</p>
<pre><code>Refactoring Applied:
- Inappropriate Intimacy
    - Hide Delegate
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Observed Code Smells After Refactoring:
- None
</code></pre>
