				<main><h1>Middle Man</h1>
<h2>Description (What)</h2>
<p>Middle Man is a class whose sole purpose in existence is to act as an intermediary between two other classes.</p>
<h2>How to Locate It (Where)</h2>
<p>Look at classes that simply act as a gateway for data to passed between two other classes. Classes that do only delegation work of moving data are generally considered as <code>Middle Man</code>s. Remember that a <code>Middle Man</code> doesn't do anything more than this. If a class looks like a <code>Middle Man</code> but also performs actual work on the data itself like processing, cleaning, converting, it is not a <code>Middle Man</code>.</p>
<h2>How It Manifests (Why)</h2>
<p>Trying to minimize the <code>Message Chains</code> code smell might end up bringing about this code smell.</p>
<p>It can also occur due to the slow removal of functions of a class to the point where it only delegates work at one stage.</p>
<h2>How to Fix It (Possible Treatments)</h2>
<p>In Example 1, <code>Remove Middle Man</code> treatment is used which simply means deleting the class that acts as a middle man and rerouting method calls directly to the main class which the middle man was acting as a facade for.</p>
<p>Other treatments are also possible based on the specific scenario, they can be found <a href="https://refactoring.guru/smells/middle-man#:~:text=Treatment">here</a></p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<h3>Example 1</h3>
<h4>Problem MMBE1.java</h4>
<p><code>ProductHandler</code> acts as a middleman to <code>ProductManager</code> by giving it access to only what it needs.</p>
<pre><code>Observed Code Smells:
- Middle Man (lines 55-66)
- Data Class (line 55-66)
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h4>Solution MMBE1.java</h4>
<p>Used <code>Remove Middle Man</code> by removing <code>ProductHandler</code> and letting <code>ProductManager</code> directly use <code>Product</code> methods</p>
<pre><code>Refactoring Applied:
- Middle Man
    - Remove Middle Man (removed ProductHandler)
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Observed Code Smells After Refactoring:
- None
</code></pre>
<h2>When to Ignore</h2>
<p>In cases where a design pattern like the Proxy or Decorator Design Patterns are used</p>
<p>In cases where adding a middle man removes unnecessary interdependence between two classes</p>
